## Rules that apply to all contributions

- Avoid comments unless there is some message that the user needs to follow up on. Prefer descriptive funciton names.
- This is a strongly typed codebase. All types that are committed to datastore should be saved to `types.ts`. Avoid all use of `any`: if a proper type cannot be determined, stop and ask the user for clarification.
- Prefer a single wide log for all interactions. Don't log at every step of the process. Log errors explicitly.

## UX concerns

- Use HeroUI's `addToast` function for user messages. Don't use `alert()`.
